echo "Kite hunting in the Batununggal <hr> field On September 26, 2010, I played with my friend hunting a kite in a rice field. During a pleasant illness I went to the rice field with a long bamboo to carry it, to hunt more easily. after I got to the merger paddy field I immediately hunted kites with my friend and many kites that lost above my head, I immediately climbed the losing kite by forcing many shy princess plants that stabbed into my feet and I was very sore and sick. when I fight that losing kite with someone else I almost want to fight.And finally the losing kite got me. And when it was dark I was immediately ready to go home. and on the way I saw a cobra said my friend we killed the snake and hit it with bamboo that I brought and finally the snake died.And the conclusion is that today's kids are jajah with the name of a handphone kids these days have never tried the name of hunting kites in the fields";
